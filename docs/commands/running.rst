Running
=======

Running the program.

There are two kinds of action that can be done when a program is
stopped *Continuing* means resuming program execution until the
program completes normally or a *breakpoint* is encountered. In
contrast, *stepping* means executing just some Python code and then
stopping again. Of course in either action an error may occur or the
program may terminate normally.
